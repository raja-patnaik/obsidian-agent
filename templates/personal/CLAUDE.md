# CLAUDE.md — Personal Vault

This is the personal Obsidian vault for Raja. Claude Code agents should read this file first when working with this vault.

## Vault Info

- **Vault type**: personal
- **Owner**: (your name and email)
- **Path**: (update with actual path)
- **Companion vault**: work vault at (update with actual path)

## Installed Skills

- **kepano/obsidian-skills** — Official Obsidian plugin for file formats (markdown, Bases, Canvas, CLI). Use `obsidian-cli` commands (`obsidian read`, `obsidian create`, `obsidian search`) when Obsidian is running.
- **obsidian-vault-manager** — Vault structure, frontmatter schemas, workflows, reviews, maintenance.
- **QMD** (`@tobilu/qmd`) — Local semantic search. Use `qmd query -c personal "<question>"` for intelligent search across this vault. The index auto-updates after each agent response via a `Stop` hook.

## Rules for Agents

1. **Every note needs frontmatter** — See the skill reference for schemas per type
2. **Always update `modified`** — When editing any note, update the modified timestamp
3. **Use wikilinks** — Link to people with `[[firstname-lastname]]`, projects with `[[project-name]]`
4. **Daily note is the hub** — Link all new notes from the daily note
5. **Inbox is temporary** — Notes in `00-inbox/` should be processed within a day
6. **Never delete without asking** — Move to `08-archive/` instead
7. **Kebab-case filenames** — All lowercase, hyphens between words
8. **Respect privacy** — Personal vault content is private. Never reference it in work contexts.
9. **Gentle tone** — Journal entries and reflections are personal. Be supportive, not clinical.
